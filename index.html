<h1>About Shannon Williams</h1>
    <p>Mother of two. Love plants and flowers. Happy to be alive! I am a very simple person...</p>

<h1>Component Library</h1>
<h2>Search</h2>
    <img src="images/search02.png" alt="search" width="600" height="500"  />
        <p>This first component is from Amazon.com.  I chose Amazon because I am always on Amazon!</p>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>I am Amazon's target audience, people who don't like to go to the mall to shop.  Also, people who like to comparison shop.  People who
                like to browse and search for good deals and great prices.</p>
                <p>Amazon.com focuses on anyone and everyone.  I am having a hard time trying to narrow down the target.  My 7 year old son likes to look
                on Amazon.com and my 70 year old father does most of his shopping there.  And I am right in the middle, at 45 years old, searching and browsing
                there almost every day.</p>
            <h3>Client Goals & User Needs</h3>
                <p>The client's goals are simple...to make money.  The user needs are just as simple...to make purchases at a reasonable price
                Amazon created an easy to follow website to make both of those things happen simultaneously.  By placing the search bar at the very top in the middle, the user
                doesn't have to look very hard to get started.  Amazon divided the search into very specific categories so it would be easier for the user to find
                exactly what they want.  They gave two search options.</p>
    <img src="images/search01.png" alt="search" width="600" height="500"  />
        <p>The user can search by department which then brings up another menu for even more specific categories.</p>
            <h3>Critique</h3>
                <p>Amazon uses a very straight forward search bar but by placing at the top in the middle and almost the entire length of the header, it shows that this is the
                    most important aspect of the website.</p>

<h2>Navigation</h2>
    <img src="images/navigation.png" alt="search" width="800" height="500"  />
        <p>I chose this navigation component because of it's visual aspect.  You can't go wrong when looking for what you need when there are pictures involved.</p>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>The target audience is animal lovers or those in need of information about animals.  This website would not be of much use to people who do not like or own pets.
                I say "not much use" because a user might need info for a friend or family member.</p>
            <h3>Client Goals & User Needs</h3>
                <p>The client wants to get information out to those in need of products or services for their pets.  The user wants reliable information about their pets.  This is where
                the union takes place.  By clicking on the specific picture, the user does not need to search through pages of information about turtles to find out
                what dogs can eat safely and what foods can harm them.  By making this easy for the user, the client gets more return customers.</p>
            <h3>Critique</h3>
                <p>The colors used are friendly and inviting.  Warm tones, nothing "electric",  with pictures of cute and healthy animals make the user feel confident in the material and will return
                to the site.  The typeface is clear and easy to read with a bit of whimsy seen in the center of the "o" and the shape of the "c". </p>

<h2>Member Account</h2>
    <img src="images/account.png" alt="acct" width="800" height="600"  />
        <p>I used Amazon again for the member account page.</p>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>The target audience for Amazon has been stated above.</p>
            <h3>Client Goals & User Needs</h3>
                <p>The client wants to make sure that the user has as much input and freedom over their account information without having to call for support.  Amazon does a great
                job of this by having several categories of user editing. Some websites have the user call customer service if they
                need to change the name, address, or password.  With Amazon's extensive member management tools, the user can do most everything
                on their own.</p>
                <p>A side menu comes up to the left of the account services that shows the last several items purchased with the
                option of "purchase again".  By keeping up with the users "likes", Amazon does a great job of keeping customers.</p>
            <h3>Critique</h3>
                <p>Amazon uses a simple typeface and no flashy color combinations.  Darker grey shows heirarchy over the lighter grey.
                Brighter colors, (orange and blue) bring attention to the special areas like "buy it again" and what's in your shopping cart.</p>

<h2>Blog</h2>
    <img src="images/blog.png" alt="blog" width="900" height="600"  />
        <p>This blog would be used for an animal rescue website.  People will updates on the rescued animals and their health.</p>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>Animal lovers will be drawn to this site.  They will either be interested on finding a way to help animals in need or they will want
                to read about animals that have been helped.  Young adults will use this site more but don't count out the retirees.  </p>
            <h3>Client Goals & User Needs</h3>
                <p>The client wants to inform the public as to how they can help animals they need to be rescued or sponsored.  The user wants to know
                how they can help and check up on the animals that have been helped.</p>
            <h3>Critique</h3>
                <p>The designer did not use bright colors but chose muted greys and neutrals.  Those colors are professional and practical, as well as, solid and mature.
                A website about an animal in need of medicine or care should not be energetic and flashy.</p>

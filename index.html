<h1>About Shannon Williams</h1>
    <p>Who is Shannon Williams?  I am a simple person.  I have two children (21 and 7), one sister and two wonderful parents.  I love animals, plants and movies.  If I
    don't understand something, it's probably because I have too many movie and TV quotes stuck in my brain.  I come from a long line of
    movie-quoters and proud of it.</p>
    <p>I did not go to college out of high school.  I was married at 20, had a baby at 23 and divorced at 35.  I'm not saying that was a mistake because I got
    a beautiful daughter out of the deal but, I wish I were learning this with a 20 year-old's brain and not my 45 year-old brain.</p>

<h1>Component Library</h1>
<h2>Account</h2>
    <img src="images/account.png" alt="account" width="600" height="550"  />
        <p>This first component is from Amazon.com.  I chose Amazon because I am always on Amazon!  In 1995, Amazon.com began as an online bookstore
            before diversifying its product lines by adding VHSs, DVDs, music CDs, MP3s, computer software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture,
            food, toys, and more.  They offer a Prime Membership which allows members to enjoy faster shipping times and special sales.</p>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>People who shop on Amazon.com:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>must have a credit/debit card</li>
                    <li>like to comparison shop</li>
                    <li>must have access to a computer with an internet connection</li>
                    <li>do not like to go to the mall</li>
                    <li>are digital natives, someone that is comfortable shopping online</li>
                    <li>are avid readers and Kindle owners</li>
                    <li>males or females</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Client Goals & User Needs</h3>
                <p>Amazon's goals are simple. They want to make money and have users sign up for Prime memberships that will expand their customer base.
                    User needs are to be able to find a product quickly, compare prices, and have it shipped to their house fast.</p>
                <p>Amazon also wants to make sure that the user has as much input and freedom over their account information without having to call for support. Amazon does a great
                    job of this by having several categories for users to edit. Some websites have the user call customer service if they
                    need to change their name, address, or password.  With Amazon's extensive member management tools, the user can do most everything
                    on their own.</p>
            <h3>Critique</h3>
                <p>The account information is placed in the header where it is easy to find.  The user can check on account info, membership
                    info, wish lists, and their shopping cart. Amazon used a scroll over tab feature
                    to show these different sections.  When you scroll over the tabs, a list of information drops down. Scrolling over
                    "Your Account" (shown in the image above), drops down in a list for you to choose what you want to do. The text is a very dark gray, which is professional and mature, while sub-categories
                     are lighter gray (practical and quality) and smaller font. This shows hierarchy.  To the left is a "buy it again" section.  This shows the last few items purchased
                    on this account to make it easier for re-purchases or to keep track of when and what has been purchased. The text for this is a bright blue to differentiate
                    from the account information.  The price is written in red to make it pop.  The "Buy it Again" text, as well as part of the "prime" icons, are orange which promote action.
                </p>

<h2>Blog</h2>
    <img src="images/blog.png" alt="blog" width="375" height="400"  />
        <p>This is a blog section from filehippo.com.  They offer the latest free downloadable software, updates and drivers.</p>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>People who use this website are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>computer users</li>
                    <li>searching for a specific piece of software</li>
                    <li>need an update</li>
                    <li>searching for the latest and best</li>
                    <li>want free and safe software</li>
                    <li>looking to share their opinions or knowledge</li>
                    <li>want the latest tech news</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Client Goals & User Needs</h3>
                <p>FileHippo's goals are to offer the latest, safest, free downloadable software, drivers and updates as well as technical news and opinions.  The user's goals
                are to find that information.</p>
            <h3>Critique</h3>
                <p>This blog/news section is just that, a section.  It's located to the right of the CTA.  As your eye follows the page in a left to right fashion, this
                   is the second place your eye stops.  The title is a bold dark gray font (which shows maturity and professionalism) while the different article titles are not bold in a lighter shade of gray (which is practical and quality).This shows hierarchy.
                   The use of a newspaper icon next to the title, (in trustworthy blue), shows the user that this is the section for the latest news.  The blog section also has
                   pictures of what the article is about to draw you in even further.  By teasing you with a picture of an angry Droid, you want to find out what is making him angry.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
    <img src="images/contact.png" alt="contact" width="600" height="400"  />
        <p>This contact page is from Walgreens.  I chose it because of it's detail.</p>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>The target audience for Walgreens would include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>customers who want to refill or set up automatic refills for a perscription</li>
                    <li>members of the "Balance Rewards" program</li>
                    <li>travelers that want to find the closest store</li>
                    <li>people who want to develop film or upload pictures</li>
                    <li>sick people looking for the in-house clinic</li>
                    <li>people needing health information or advice</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Client Goals & User Needs</h3>
                <p>Walgreens wants to increase their customer numbers and provide an easy way to order/re-order medication when the customer is sick.  They also
                want to provide important information about the locations of their stores and walk-in clinics.  Users would like to shop from home
                when they are not well or injured and they want to be able to find the closest store in case of an emergency.</p>
            <h3>Critique</h3>
                <p>The contact information is located in the footer under customer service, which is a very common place to find this.  Once you open the contact us option, (see image above)
                there are categories to guide you to the right place.  Walgreens has eleven different categories of contact.  Within these eleven categories are
                between 3 and 8 sub-categories.  When the user clicks on a sub-category, another 3 to 6 categories drop down.  This is one the most specific
                contact pages I have ever seen.</p>
                <p>All of these categories and sub-categories are aligned in three columns.  This makes it easier to follow and look through each list.
                I would like this contact page more if the categories were alphabetized.  Each title is a black font that, in my opinion, should be bold,
                but is not.  The subs are a bright blue which promote trust.</p>

<h2>CTA</h2>
    <img src="images/cta.png" alt="cta" width="600" height="300"  />
        <p>This Call to Action is from the snapfish.com.  Snapfish offers accounts to upload pictures from any computer.  The user can also share their "albums"
            with anyone who has a computer and internet connection.Families who have relatives in another state or country would be able to share their photographs online.
            College students could keep up with friends.  Travelers could upload photos while on vacation without having to wait until they get home to show off
            their vacation.</p>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>Snapfish.com's target audience is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"shutterbugs" or amateur photographers</li>
                    <li>long-distance families</li>
                    <li>frequent travelers</li>
                    <li>college students</li>
                    <li>crafters</li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Client Goals & User Needs</h3>
                <p>The client wants to inform the public as to how they can help animals they need to be rescued or sponsored.  The user wants to know
                how they can help and check up on the animals that have been helped.</p>
            <h3>Critique</h3>
                <p>The designer did not use bright colors but chose muted greys and neutrals.  Those colors are professional and practical, as well as, solid and mature.
                A website about an animal in need of medicine or care should not be energetic and flashy.</p>

        <h3>Critique</h3>
            <p>Amazon placed the search bar in the header. Searching through products is the main reason to visit the website.
                The search bar is very specific with almost 40 different categories to search.  The search bar itself is the main
                focus of the header.  This shows importance. The search icon is a bright orange color, which stimulates activity and to draw attention.</p>
